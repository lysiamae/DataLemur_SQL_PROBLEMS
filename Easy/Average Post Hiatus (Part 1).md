Given a table of Facebook posts, for each user who posted at least twice in 2021, write a query to find the number of days between each userâ€™s first post of the year and last post of the year in the year 2021. Output the user and number of the days between each user's first and last post.

#### Table: posts
|Column Name    | Type |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| user_id  | integer    |
| post_id| integer  |
| post_date | timestamp |
|post_content | text|

####  posts Example Input
| user_id   | post_id| post_date | post_content|
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
|151652|	599415|	07/10/2021 12:00:00|	Need a hug|
|661093	|624356|	07/29/2021 13:00:00	|Bed. Class 8-12. Work 12-3. Gym 3-5 or 6. Then class 6-10. Another day that's gonna fly by. I miss my girlfriend|
|004239|	784254|	07/04/2021 11:00:00	|Happy 4th of July!|

## Example Output:
| user_id | days_between|
|----|----|
|151652| 2|
| 661093 | 21|


##### Explanation
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example!**

My solution and comments are shown below.
### SOLUTION: 
```sql
WITH T AS (SELECT user_id, EXTRACT(DAY FROM MAX(post_date)-MIN(post_date)) AS days_between
FROM posts
where EXTRACT(year from post_date) = 2021
GROUP BY user_id)

SELECT user_id, days_between FROM T 
where days_between !=0;
```
MAX() AND MIN() can be used to obtain the last and first post_date. Since the post_date is in timestamp format we must use EXTRACT() to get the days between the last and first post_date of a certain user.The GROUP BY statement ensure that the MIN() AND MAX() post_date will be evaluated for each user, not for the whole column.
