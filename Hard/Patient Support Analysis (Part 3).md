# Patient Support Analysis (Part 3) 
#### [Hard]
  ----
UnitedHealth Group has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows members to call an advocate and receive support for their health care needs â€“ whether that's behavioural, clinical, well-being, health care financing, benefits, claims or pharmacy help.

Write a query to get the patients who made a call within 7 days of their previous call. If a patient called more than twice in a span of 7 days, count them as once.

#### Table: callers 
|Column Name| Type|
| ---- | ---|
|policy_holder_id|	integer
|case_id|	varchar
|call_category|	varchar
|call_received|	timestamp
|call_duration_secs|	integer
|original_order|	integer

#### callers Example Input:
|policy_holder_id|	case_id	|call_category|	call_received|	call_duration_secs|	original_order|
| ------| -----| ----| -----| ----- | -----|
|50837000|	dc63-acae-4f39-bb04|	claims	|3/9/2022 2:51|	205	|130
|50837000|	41be-bebe-4bd0-a1ba|	IT_support|	3/12/2022 5:37|	254	|129
|50837000|	bab1-3ec5-4867-90ae	|benefits|	5/13/2022 18:19|	228	|339
|50936674|	12c8-b35c-48a3-b38d|	claims	|5/31/2022 7:27|	240	|31
|50886837|	d0b4-8ea7-4b8c-aa8b	|IT_support|	3/11/2022 3:38|	276|	16
|50886837|	a741-c279-41c0-90ba	|	|3/19/2022 10:52 |131|	325


#### Example Output:
|patient_count|
|----|
|1|



##### Explanation
Only patient 50837000 made another call (on March 12th, 2022) within 7 days of the last call (on March 9th, 2022).
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - **this is just an example!**




My solution is shown below.
### SOLUTION: 
```sql
WITH CALL AS (SELECT policy_holder_id,  call_received as current_call, 
LAG(call_received) OVER(PARTITION BY policy_holder_id ORDER BY call_received) as prev_call,
(EXTRACT(EPOCH from call_received)- EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM LAG(call_received) OVER(PARTITION BY policy_holder_id ORDER BY call_received)))
/(24*60*60)
as diff_days
FROM callers)

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT policy_holder_id) from CALL
where diff_days <= 7;

```
NOTE: To obtain the days difference, it is important to convert the difference between current call and previous call in seconds then converting it to minutes, hours, and day. I made an initial mistake of doing EXTRACT(DAY FROM current_call) - EXTRACT(DAY FROM prev_call) that just returned me a negative day difference for days that are not in the same months.
